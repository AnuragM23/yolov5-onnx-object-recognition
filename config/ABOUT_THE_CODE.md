This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of object detection using the YOLOv5 model with OpenCV. Let's break down the code step by step:

# This section is for `yolov5.py`:

### Constants and Definitions:
- `cv2` and `numpy` are imported. `cv2` is OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.
- Various constants like `INPUT_WIDTH`, `INPUT_HEIGHT`, `SCORE_THRESHOLD`, `NMS_THRESHOLD`, `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `FONT_FACE`, `FONT_SCALE`, `THICKNESS`, and `COLORS` are defined.

```python
# Constants.
INPUT_WIDTH = 640
  # Rest of the function

# Text parameters.
FONT_FACE = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
  # Rest of the function

# Colors
BLACK  = (0,0,0)
  # Rest of the function
```

### Helper Functions:
1. **`draw_label`**: Draws a label (text) on an image at a specified location.
   
2. **`pre_process`**: Prepares the image for inference by converting it into a 4D blob suitable for the YOLOv5 model.
   
3. **`post_process`**: Processes the model's output to extract information about detected objects and draw bounding boxes.

```python
def draw_label(input_image, label, left, top):
    """Draw text onto image at location."""
    
    # Get text size.
    text_size = cv2.getTextSize(label, FONT_FACE, FONT_SCALE, THICKNESS)

    # Rest of the function

def pre_process(input_image, net):
	# Create a 4D blob from a frame.
	blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(input_image, 1/255, (INPUT_WIDTH, INPUT_HEIGHT), [0,0,0], 1, crop=False)

    # Rest of the function

def post_process(input_image, outputs):
	# Lists to hold respective values while unwrapping.
	class_ids = []
	confidences = []
	boxes = []

  # Rest of the function
```

### Main Function (`if __name__ == '__main__':`):
- Loads the class names from a file called "coco.names".
  
- Reads an input image using `cv2.imread`.
  
- Loads the YOLOv5 model weights using `cv2.dnn.readNet`.
  
- Calls the `pre_process` and `post_process` functions to process the image and extract object detection results.
  
- Computes the inference time and displays it on the image.
  
- Displays the processed image using `cv2.imshow` and waits for a key press.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
	# Load class names.
	classesFile = "coco.names"
	classes = None
	with open(classesFile, 'rt') as f:
		classes = f.read().rstrip('\n').split('\n')

  # Rest of the function
```

### Explanation of Processing:
1. **Pre-processing (`pre_process` function)**:
   - Converts the input image to a suitable format (`blob`) for the YOLOv5 model.
   - Sets the input to the network and runs a forward pass to get the output.

2. **Post-processing (`post_process` function)**:
   - Processes the model's output to extract information about detected objects.
   - Filters out low-confidence detections and performs non-maximum suppression.
   - Draws bounding boxes and labels on the image for detected objects.

3. **Displaying Output**:
   - The processed image with bounding boxes and labels is displayed using `cv2.imshow`.

### Note:
- The model weights (`modelWeights`) and class names (`classesFile`) are assumed to be available in the specified paths.
- The script processes a single image (`sample6.jpg`) and displays the detection results.

Overall, this script demonstrates a basic implementation of YOLOv5-based object detection using OpenCV, from loading the model to processing the image and displaying the results.

# This section is for `app.py`:

This code demonstrates the integration of object detection using the YOLOv5 model with OpenCV within a Streamlit app. Let's break it down step by step:

### Importing Libraries:
1. **`cv2`**: OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.
2. **`numpy`**: A fundamental package for numerical operations in Python.
3. **`streamlit`**: A web app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

### Constants and Helper Functions (Copied from Original Code):
- Constants and helper functions were explained in the previous explanation and remain the same in this context.

### Loading YOLOv5 Model and Class Names:
- Loads the YOLOv5 model weights (`yolov5s.onnx`) and class names (`coco.names`).

### Streamlit App Setup:
- Calls `st.title` to set the title of the Streamlit app.

```python
st.title("YOLOv5 Object Detection with OpenCV")
```

### Image Upload and Processing:
1. **Image Upload**:
   - Provides a file uploader (`st.file_uploader`) to allow users to upload an image.
  
```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose an image...", type=["jpg", "png", "jpeg"])
```

2. **Image Processing**:
   - If an image is uploaded, it decodes the image using OpenCV (`cv2.imdecode`) and displays the uploaded image using `st.image`.
   - Calls the `pre_process` and `post_process` functions (from the original code) to process the image and extract object detection results.
   - Computes the inference time and displays it on the processed image.
   - Displays the processed image using `st.image`.

```python
if uploaded_file is not None:
    # Load class names
    classesFile = "coco.names"
    classes = None
    with open(classesFile, 'rt') as f:
        classes = f.read().rstrip('\n').split('\n')

    # Load image
    frame = cv2.imdecode(np.fromstring(uploaded_file.read(), np.uint8), 1)

    # Rest of the Code
```

### Note:
- The Streamlit app interface is built around the process of uploading an image, processing it for object detection, and displaying the results.

Overall, this code sets up a Streamlit app that allows users to upload an image, processes it using the YOLOv5 model, and displays the original and processed images with object detection results.
